<h3>Description: </h3>
<p style="line-height: 1.25;">Dungeon Delver Dan is dedicated to exploring dungeons and uncovering their mysteries and secrets. It is and always has been his life’s work. However, on one of his many trips to a dungeon, he came face to face with a horde of monsters! Unable to retreat, our valiant hero was knocked out and brought to the monster’s dungeon. When Dan wakes up, all of the monsters have gone out on a raid giving the dungeon delver time to escape from his cell. However, escaping will not be that easy. The monsters are very picky with their security. Due to this slight hiccup in Dan’s plans, Dan must use all of his creativity to escape from his dungeon and see the beautiful light of day once more.</p><br>
